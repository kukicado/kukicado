## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ado!

I am a full-stack software engineer, international speaker, and developer evangelist.

Professionally, I am a Lead Developer Advocate at MongoDB. Prior to that I led the Developer Evangelism team and Ambassador Program at Auth0. I am a Google Developer Expert for Web Technologies and spend most my time giving talks at conferences and meetups, mentoring and running workshops, and creating online content to help technology professionals.

I have over 15 years of software development experience working with technologies like Angular, NodeJS, Go, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and many others. I have held many roles in my career ranging from engineering, research and development, and leadership in both startups and enterprises.

My passion has always been technology and education. I write tutorials, record video courses, and contribute to open source projects. I am an avid reader, occasional gamer, and tech gadget enthusiast.

If youâ€™d like to get in touch, you can find me on the social media networks above or email me directly at contact@ado.xyz.
